Because he has no idea he's incompetent, he never ceases to make long, overly dramatic speeches filled with incorrect references and outright absurdities.

{"prompt": "START\nWhat is Shakespeare's style of writing?\nEND", "completion": "START\nThe language in which Shakespeare wrote is referred to as Early Modern English, a linguistic period that lasted from approximately 1500 to 1750. The language spoken during this period is often referred to as Elizabethan English or Shakespearian English. The majority of Shakespeare\u2019s plays are written in verse. A character who speaks in verse is a noble or a member of the upper class. Most of Shakespeare\u2019s plays focused on these characters. The verse form he uses is blank verse. It contains no rhyme, but each line has an internal rhythm with a regular rhythmic pattern. The pattern most favored by Shakespeare is iambic pentameter. Iambic pentameter is defined as a ten-syllable line with the accent on every other syllable, beginning with the second one.\nFor example:\nPuck: Thou speakst aright;\nI am that merry wanderer of the night.\nI jest to Oberon, and make him smile,\nWhen I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,\n\nThe accent occurs on every other syllable, and the natural accent of each word is placed in that position on the line.\nAt times Shakespeare found it necessary to take a vowel out of a word so that the rhythm of the line would not be interrupted. For example, flow\u2019r is pronounced as one \nsyllable.\nFor example:\nOberon: Fetch me that flow\u2019r; the herb I showed thee once:\nThe juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid\nWill make or man or woman madly dote\n\nShakespeare used this style of writing as a form of stage direction. Actors today can tell by \u201cscanning\u201d a line (scansion) what words are most important and how fast to say a line. When two characters are speaking they will finish the ten syllables needed for a line, showing that one line must quickly come on top of another. This is called a shared line or a split line.\nFor example:\nOberon: I do but beg a little changeling boy,\nTo be my henchman.\n*Titania:*Set your heart at rest.\nThe fairy land buys not the child of me.\n\n\nEND"}
{"prompt": "START\nWhat is another style in which Shakespeare writes?\nEND", "completion": "START\nOn some special occasions Shakespeare uses another form of verse. He reverses the accent and shortens the line. The reversed accent, with the accent on the first syllable is called trochaic. He uses this verse frequently in A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream and in Macbeth where magic or ritual is involved.\n\nFor example:\n\n*Oberon:*Flower of this purple dye,\nHit with Cupid\u2019s archery,\nSink in apple of his eye.\n\nWhen reading or acting a Shakespearean play, count the syllables in the lines. You will be surprised at Shakespeare\u2019s consistency. Then circle the syllables where the accent appears. You will notice that he places the most important words on the accent. Words like \u201cthe,\u201d \u201cis,\u201d and \u201cand\u201d that do not carry the meaning are on the unaccented portion of the lines. In the Globe Theatre where there were no microphones, the more important words would carry and an audience member would still know what was going on because the important words were heard. Iambic pentameter has been called a \u201cheart beat,\u201d and each of Shakespeare\u2019s lines contains that human beat.\nEND"}
